# 🎨 **DRAMATIC UI/UX IMPROVEMENT: From Single Button Hell to Context-Aware Interface**

## ❌ **The Problem: Terrible User Experience**

### **Before: Single Button Confusion**

```
[🚀 Start TLA+ Training] ← Only button, behavior changes mysteriously
```

**User Experience Issues:**

- 🤔 **Users never know what's happening or what they can do**
- 😡 **Button disabled with no explanation during training**
- 🎭 **Button text never changes to reflect current state**
- 📱 **No clear feedback about system status**

## ✅ **The Solution: Context-Aware Multi-Button Interface**
