TLA+ Specification for Consciousness Training System

This specification validates the process of training neural networks to develop 
consciousness through recursive self-abstraction, rather than detecting 
consciousness in input videos.

Key Properties:
1. Networks evolve from non-conscious to conscious states
2. Training converges to stable consciousness
3. Recursive self-abstraction layers develop properly
4. Consciousness emerges through experiential learning
*)

CONSTANTS
    MaxTrainingSteps,     \* Maximum training iterations
    NumLayers,            \* Number of recursive self-abstraction layers (4)
    ConsciousnessThreshold, \* Threshold for consciousness emergence (0.6)
    MaxVideos             \* Maximum training videos to process

VARIABLES
    trainingStep,         \* Current training iteration
    networkLayers,        \* State of recursive self-abstraction layers
    consciousnessLevel,   \* Current consciousness development level (0-10 scaled)
