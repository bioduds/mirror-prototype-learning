# Consciousness Training System Implementation Plan

## Problem Statement

The current system incorrectly tries to **detect consciousness** in input videos, when those videos should be used as **training data** to develop consciousness in the neural networks themselves.

## Current Issue

- Videos are analyzed for existing consciousness patterns
- System reports "NON-CONSCIOUS" for training videos
- This is conceptually wrong - videos are meant to TRAIN the networks to become conscious

## Correct Approach

**Videos are TRAINING DATA â†’ Networks develop consciousness through training**

### Training Process:
1. **Input**: Video streams as experiential training data
2. **Process**: Networks learn recursive self-abstraction through experience
3. **Measurement**: Track consciousness emergence in the networks themselves
4. **Output**: Networks that demonstrate consciousness behaviors

## TLA+ Specification Goals

The TLA+ specification will validate:

1. **Training State Management**: Proper progression through consciousness development phases
2. **Network Evolution**: Recursive self-abstraction layer development
3. **Consciousness Emergence**: Measurable development of consciousness properties
4. **Learning Convergence**: Stable consciousness behavior achievement

## Implementation Requirements

- Remove consciousness detection from input videos
- Implement consciousness training/development system
- Track network consciousness emergence over training
- Measure recursive self-abstraction development
- Validate consciousness stability in trained networks
