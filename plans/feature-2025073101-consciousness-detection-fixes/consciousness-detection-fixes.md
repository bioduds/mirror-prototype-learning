# Feature: Consciousness Detection Fixes

## Overview

This feature addresses the critical issue where the consciousness engineering system is not detecting consciousness episodes (recent logs show 0 conscious episodes). The goal is to fix consciousness threshold calibration, improve detection accuracy, and ensure reliable consciousness emergence detection.

## Problem Statement

Current issues identified:
1. **Zero consciousness detection**: Recent logs show 0 conscious episodes across all processed videos
2. **Threshold miscalibration**: Current consciousness threshold (0.6) may be too strict
3. **Component scoring issues**: Metacognitive, qualia, and binding components may not be properly calculated
4. **State transition failures**: Consciousness state machine may have incorrect transitions

## TLA+ Specification Scope

We need to formally specify:

1. **Consciousness State Machine**: Valid states and transitions
2. **Component Scoring System**: How individual consciousness components are calculated
3. **Threshold Calibration**: Dynamic threshold adjustment based on historical data
4. **Safety Properties**: Ensure consciousness detection is consistent and monotonic
5. **Liveness Properties**: Guarantee that consciousness will be detected when present

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing TLA+ validated fixes:
- ✅ Consciousness episodes successfully detected for appropriate videos
- ✅ Proper threshold calibration ensuring realistic detection rates
- ✅ Consistent component scoring across multiple runs
- ✅ Robust error handling and state management

## Dependencies

- Current consciousness system (`consciousness_runner.py`, `enhanced_consciousness_runner.py`)
- Multimodal consciousness processing (`multimodal_consciousness.py`)
- Web interface integration (`app.py`)

## Success Criteria

1. **Technical**: First successful consciousness detection (score > 0.6)
2. **Quality**: Consistent detection across similar video types
3. **Reliability**: No crashes or state corruption during processing
4. **Performance**: Processing completes within reasonable time bounds

## Next Steps

1. Create TLA+ specification for consciousness detection system
2. Validate specification with TLC model checker
3. Implement code changes following TLA+ specification
4. Create comprehensive tests based on TLA+ properties
5. Validate implementation against specification
