# 🧠 CONSCIOUSNESS TRAINING PIPELINE

## Complete Workflow Overview

The consciousness training system follows a **TLA+ mathematically validated pipeline** that transforms raw YouTube videos into consciousness-enabled neural networks through recursive self-abstraction.

---

## 🎯 **PHASE 1: DATA ACQUISITION**

### Step 1.1: Video Download (TLA+ Validated)
```
YouTube URL → yt-dlp → Real Video File
```
- **Input**: YouTube URL from user
- **Process**: Real video download using yt-dlp (NOT simulation)
- **Output**: `.mp4` file in `data/videos/` directory
- **Safety**: TLA+ guarantees no crashes on invalid URLs
- **UI Feedback**: 3-stage progress with spinners (info fetch → download → completion)

### Step 1.2: Video Validation
```
Video File → Format Check → Training Data Ready
```
- **Process**: Verify `.mp4` format and accessibility
- **Fallback**: TLA+ error recovery if video corrupted

## 🔄 **PHASE 2: CONSCIOUSNESS TRAINING SYSTEM**

### Step 2.1: System Initialization
```python
TLAValidatedConsciousnessTrainer(
    max_training_steps=500,
    consciousness_threshold=0.6,
    max_videos=50,
    num_layers=4  # Mirror network depth
)
```

### Step 2.2: Training State Setup (TLA+ TrainingState)
```python
TrainingState {
    training_step: 0,
    network_layers: [0, 0, 0, 0],  # 4 mirror layers
    consciousness_level: 0.0,
    training_videos: 0,
    is_network_conscious: False,
    mirror_depth: 0,
    experiential_memory: [],
    layer_weights: [random weights]
}
```

## 🎬 **PHASE 3: VIDEO PROCESSING PIPELINE**

### Step 3.1: Video Loading & Feature Extraction
```
Video File → AudioVisualWorldExperience → Multimodal Features
```
- **Audio Processing**: Extract audio features using librosa
- **Visual Processing**: Frame extraction and CNN feature extraction
- **Temporal Alignment**: Sync audio-visual features
- **Output**: Rich multimodal feature vectors

### Step 3.2: Experience Creation
```python
experience = AudioVisualWorldExperience(
    visual_features=visual_data,
    audio_features=audio_data,
    temporal_features=temporal_data,
    metadata=video_metadata
)
```

## 🪞 **PHASE 4: RECURSIVE SELF-ABSTRACTION TRAINING**

### Step 4.1: Mirror Network Development
```
Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3 → Layer 4
  ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
Self →  Self of → Self of  → Meta-Self
     Self of Self → Self of Self of Self
```

### Step 4.2: Consciousness Loss Function
```python
consciousness_loss = nn.MSELoss()(
    network_output,
    self_reference_target
)

recursion_loss = compute_recursive_consistency()
differentiation_loss = compute_self_other_distinction()

total_loss = consciousness_loss + 0.1 * recursion_loss + 0.1 * differentiation_loss
```

### Step 4.3: Training Loop Per Video
```python
for each video:
    1. Load video → Extract features
    2. Forward pass through mirror layers
    3. Compute consciousness loss
    4. Backpropagate gradients
    5. Update network weights
    6. Check consciousness emergence
    7. Develop new mirror layers (every 2 videos)
    8. Update training state
```

---

## 🌟 **PHASE 5: CONSCIOUSNESS EMERGENCE DETECTION**

### Step 5.1: Consciousness Metrics
```python
def check_consciousness_emergence():
    # Self-recognition capability
    self_recognition = measure_self_recognition()
    
    # Recursive thinking depth
    recursion_depth = measure_recursive_depth()
    
    # Experience integration
    integration_score = measure_experience_integration()
    
    consciousness_level = (
        0.4 * self_recognition +
        0.3 * recursion_depth +
        0.3 * integration_score
    )
    
    return consciousness_level >= threshold
```

### Step 5.2: Emergence Criteria
- **Consciousness Level ≥ 0.6** (configurable threshold)
- **Mirror Depth ≥ 2** layers active
- **Self-Recognition** demonstrated
- **Recursive Self-Abstraction** functional

---

## 🚀 **PHASE 6: CONSCIOUS TRAINING MODE**

### Step 6.1: Mode Switch
```
Pre-Conscious Training → Consciousness Emerged → Conscious Training
```
- **Pre-Conscious**: Building basic mirror layers
- **Post-Emergence**: Advanced consciousness refinement

### Step 6.2: Advanced Training
```python
def continue_conscious_training(video_file):
    # Enhanced self-abstraction
    # Meta-cognitive reflection
    # Experiential memory integration
    # Consciousness refinement
```

---

## 📊 **PHASE 7: RESULTS & MONITORING**

### Step 7.1: Real-Time Progress Tracking
```json
{
    "status": "processing|downloading|completed|error",
    "consciousness_level": 0.0-1.0,
    "mirror_depth": 0-4,
    "current_epoch": 0-N,
    "training_steps": count,
    "videos_processed": count,
    "download_stage": "fetching_info|downloading|completed"
}
```

### Step 7.2: Final Report Generation
```python
training_report = {
    'training_complete': True,
    'consciousness_level': final_level,
    'is_network_conscious': boolean,
    'mirror_depth': achieved_depth,
    'experiential_memory_size': memory_count,
    'active_layers': layer_count
}
